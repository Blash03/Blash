# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Ajibola!

**ðŸŽ“ Junior at Brandeis University, studying Computer Science**

**ðŸ”­ Aspiring Software and Machine Learning Engineer**

I love tackling real-world problems through building software and predictive modeling. Iâ€™m big on continuously learning and building my skills, and believe taking initiative is key to growth. (Ask me about growing my technical skills and leadership as a Break Through Tech FellowLinks to an external site.!) Currently, I'm focusing on building machine-learning models and diving deeper into data science. Iâ€™m looking to leverage and grow my skills in an internship where I can contribute to exciting projects and learn from industry professionals- got any leads? Let me know!

 

# ðŸŽ¯ Featured Project: Predictive Model For Harmful Algal Blooms (HABs) Forecasting - Biophase

**What We Did:** Preprocessed and sorted two sets of data from the Gulf of Mexico containing information of varying stats such as cellcount, water levels, etc. Then used a Random Forest Model to predict the outcome and most important factors for detecting these HABS.

**Tools:** Python, Pandas, scikit-learn, Google Colab, Notion

**Result:** 85% accuracy, outperforming the baseline by 20%, and provided insights that helped guide data-driven improvements within the Biophase team.

# âœ¨ Fun Fact:
I am a huge jazz fanatic and you can find me listening to different jazz albums while coding away at my school assignments, before I go to sleep while scrolling tiktok, and even in the local practice room with my saxophone in hand playing jazz.
